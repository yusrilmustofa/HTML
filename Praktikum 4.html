    <br>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
it to make a type specimen book.
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
into electronic typesetting,
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
1960s with the release of
Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
recently with desktop publishing
software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
Ipsum.
